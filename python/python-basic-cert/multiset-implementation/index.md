# Multiset Implementation

Implement a multiset data structure using
a Python object. A multiset is a set that
may contain multiple entries of the same value.

The code needs to be able to complete several operations.

1. Add value to the set.
2. Remove value from the set.
3. Query the length of the set.
4. Check for the presence of a value in the set.
