## Dependabot

Stay away from zero days with Dependabot.

```{autoyaml} .github/dependabot.yml
```

## Workflows

GitHub Actions provides a pretty complete CI/CD system and they'll let you
run a lot of pipelines for free.

### codeql

The CodeQL workflow provided by GitHub is actually pretty good also.

```{autoyaml} .github/workflows/codeql.yml
```

### documentation

This workflow produces the GitHub Pages site.

```{autoyaml} .github/workflows/documentation.yml
```

### pylint

I still like to run things through PyLint anyway.

```{autoyaml} .github/workflows/pylint.yml
```

### shell

And ShellCheck never hurt anybody either.

```{autoyaml} .github/workflows/shell.yml
```
