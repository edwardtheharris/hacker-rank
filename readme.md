And their related solutions, starting with Bash.

## Bash

The problem descriptions and their solution are
in the bash directory.

> Why don’t mermaids use Bash?
> > Because they prefer a C-Shell.

## Python

This code is in the
[Python directory](https://edwardtheharris.github.io/hacker-rank/python/index.html).

> Why do Python coders make terrible spies?
> > They’re always leaving traces.

## C++

Though I don't write a ton of C++, some problems on HackerRank lend themselves
to solutions using a statically typed language and C++
is generally the language I use if I need one of those.

## Full documentation

If you're interested in having me fix your computers for money, or you're
just a genuine masochist, you may find the complete documentation for the code
in this repository on
[the GitHub Pages site](https://edwardtheharris.github.io/hacker-rank/).

[Or, if you're running locally.](index.md)

Thanks for your time!
